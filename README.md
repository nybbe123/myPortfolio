# Submission 2 - CV
## About
The objective in this project has been to develop a personal CV by using HTML, CSS and javaScript. 
Directly at the landing page I introduce my self as well as my professions. The site is then 
structured as follows: an about me section with some background information about me, a experience 
section, a skill section, a portfolio section, and finally a contact section. The site is fully 
responsive so it can also be viewed from mobile units.
